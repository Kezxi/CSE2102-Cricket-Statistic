So as we know, cricket is actually the main sport in Guyana. 
From previous investigations, it has be proven that there is no software application available to players that allows them to view and verify their Local, Regional or International statistics.
So this project today is focused on building a software application with an online database that only grants access to certain individuals (Management Team) which keeps the statistics authentic. 
This application will not only benefit the players but also the Management/Selectors as well.
